## [1.5.6] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed

**Citation Extraction (Major Rewrite):**

- Rewrote citation excerpt extraction using `page.evaluate()` string expressions — eliminates all `ElementHandle` stale reference errors
- Source names extracted from `span[aria-label]` in a single DOM scan (100% reliable)
- Source excerpts extracted by clicking each citation → reading `i.highlighted` + parent `.paragraph` for full passage context
- Added `Escape` dismiss between each citation click to prevent stale highlight contamination
- Improved from ~50% to **97% success rate** (30/31 citations in real-world test)
- Removed all debug screenshots and verbose logging from production code

**Authentication & Session Recovery:**

- Fixed false "Authenticated" at startup: `verifyWithBrowser()` now does real browser navigation to NotebookLM to check if Google session is truly valid (not just local cookie expiry dates)
- Fixed mid-session `SESSION_EXPIRED`: auto-reauth now uses `AutoLoginManager` with stored credentials (fills email + password automatically), falls back to manual `performSetup()` if needed
- Fixed profile sync direction bug: after `performSetup()`, uses `syncMainToAccount()` (not the reverse) to avoid overwriting fresh auth with stale account cookies
- Fixed `setup-auth --force` flag to bypass cookie check and always open browser

**Port Management:**

- Added `EADDRINUSE` handling: detects ghost processes on port 3000, attempts auto-kill, provides clear error message if port cannot be freed

### Added

**Chrome Profile Auto-Sync:**

- `syncProfileToMain(accountId)`: copies account-specific state/profile → main `chrome_profile/`
- `syncMainToAccount(accountId)`: reverse sync after interactive re-auth
- Both called automatically at the right points in startup and mid-session flows

**Startup Browser Verification (Step 4):**

- New `verifyWithBrowser()` method launches headless browser, navigates to NotebookLM, checks actual URL
- If redirected to `accounts.google.com` → triggers auto-reauth with `AutoLoginManager` (automatic) or `performSetup()` (manual fallback)

---

## [1.5.5] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

**Authentication State Path Mismatch (Critical Bug):**

- Fixed `/health` endpoint and session recovery checking wrong path for authentication cookies
- **Root cause:** Multi-account system saves cookies to `accounts/{id}/browser_state/state.json` but code was checking legacy global path `CONFIG.browserStateDir/state.json`
- Fixed in 4 files:
  - `src/startup/startup-manager.ts` - Now uses account-specific state path at startup
  - `src/tools/index.ts` - Health endpoint checks account-specific state with fallback
  - `src/session/shared-context-manager.ts` - Context recreation loads from correct path
  - `src/session/browser-session.ts` - Session recovery uses account-specific state
- All files maintain fallback to legacy AuthManager path for backward compatibility

**Health Endpoint Improvements:**

- Added `current_account` field to health response showing active account email
- Added `accountCheckDone` flag to ensure proper fallback to AuthManager in tests

### Added

**Windows Startup Scripts:**

- `scripts/start-server-hidden.vbs` - VBScript to launch HTTP server silently at Windows startup
- `scripts/stop-server.bat` - Batch script to stop running server processes
- `scripts/mcp-proxy-hidden.ps1` - PowerShell script for hidden window MCP proxy

**Claude Code MCP Integration:**

- Hidden window configuration for MCP stdio proxy in Claude Code projects
- Uses `powershell -WindowStyle Hidden` to avoid shell window popup on each tool call
- Example `.mcp.json` configuration in documentation

---

## [1.5.4] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

**Citation Source Format (Critical Bug):**

- Fixed `source_format` parameter not being passed from HTTP `/ask` endpoint to handler
- The parameter was defined in the schema but never extracted from `req.body` in `http-wrapper.ts`
- All source formats now work correctly: `none`, `inline`, `footnotes`, `json`, `expanded`

**Citation Extraction:**

- Updated `CITATION_SELECTORS` for current NotebookLM DOM (January 2026):
  - Primary: `button.citation-marker`, `button.xap-inline-dialog.citation-marker`
  - Fallback selectors for backwards compatibility
- Updated `TOOLTIP_SELECTORS` for source text extraction:
  - Primary: `i.highlighted`, `.paragraph i.highlighted`
- New `extractSourceFromElement()` function extracts both:
  - `sourceName`: from `aria-label` attribute (e.g., "17: Filename.pdf")
  - `sourceText`: from hover tooltip content

**Docker/noVNC:**

- Fixed Xvfb startup error: `_XSERVTransmkdir: ERROR: euid != 0`
- Added `/tmp/.X11-unix` directory creation with proper permissions (1777) in Dockerfile
- Changed exposed port from 5900 (raw VNC) to 6080 (noVNC web interface) in docker-compose.yml

### Added

---

## [1.3.3] - 2025-01-26

### Security

**CORS Hardening:**

- Added CORS whitelist configuration via `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Default whitelist allows only localhost origins (ports 3000, 5678, 8080)
- Blocked external origins no longer receive CORS headers
- Supports wildcard `*` for development when explicitly configured

**Input Validation:**

- Added Zod schema validation for all HTTP endpoints
- Validates request bodies with detailed error messages
- Schemas: AskQuestionSchema, AddNotebookSchema, UpdateNotebookSchema, AutoDiscoverSchema, CleanupDataSchema, ShowBrowserSchema

- Prevents route hijacking vulnerabilities

### Fixed

**Error Handling:**

- Replaced 30+ empty catch blocks with proper `log.debug()` logging
- Improved error visibility for debugging without breaking functionality

**Type Safety:**

- Refactored `ToolResult<T>` to discriminated union type for compile-time safety

- `test-cors.ps1` (10 tests) - CORS configuration testing
- `test-sessions.ps1` (10 tests) - Session management testing
- Fixed `test-errors.ps1` pattern matching for Zod validation messages

---

## [1.3.2] - 2025-01-24

### Added

**Authentication Management:**

- New MCP tool `de_auth` for secure logout (clears all credentials without re-authenticating)
- Separation of concerns: `de_auth` (logout only), `re_auth` (logout + re-authenticate), `setup_auth` (first-time)
- HTTP API endpoints for complete authentication lifecycle:
  - `POST /de-auth` - Logout and clear credentials
  - `POST /re-auth` - Re-authenticate with different account
  - `POST /cleanup-data` - Clean all data (requires confirmation)

**HTTP API Feature Parity:**

- Added 7 missing endpoints to achieve 100% parity with MCP stdio tools
- Authentication: `/de-auth`, `/re-auth`, `/cleanup-data`
- Notebooks: `PUT /notebooks/:id`, `/notebooks/search`, `/notebooks/stats`
- Sessions: `POST /sessions/:id/reset`
- All 22 endpoints now available via both HTTP REST API and MCP stdio

**Documentation:**

- Complete API reference updated with all 22 endpoints in `deployment/docs/03-API.md`
- Added curl examples and request/response schemas for all new endpoints
- Categorized endpoints by type (Authentication, Queries, Notebooks, Sessions)

### Fixed

**Authentication Preservation:**

- Critical fix: `setup_auth` no longer erases existing authentication
- Added check for existing auth before clearing credentials
- Users can now switch between HTTP and MCP stdio modes without re-authenticating
- Preserves user experience when switching interfaces

**Code Quality:**

- Refactored `re_auth` to use `de_auth` internally (DRY principle)
- Improved separation of concerns in authentication flow
- Better error handling in HTTP wrapper

### Changed

**Version Synchronization:**

- Updated all version references across codebase to 1.3.2
- Synchronized versions in package.json, src/index.ts, src/http-wrapper.ts, README.md
- Consistent versioning across all documentation files

---

## [1.3.1] - 2025-01-24

### Added

**MCP Auto-Discovery Tool:**

- New MCP tool `auto_discover_notebook` for Claude Desktop/Cursor integration
- Automatically generates notebook metadata via NotebookLM (30 seconds vs 5 minutes)
- Zero-friction notebook addition: just provide URL, metadata is auto-generated
- Parity with HTTP API: MCP clients now have same auto-discovery capability

**Documentation:**

- Added `docs/CHROME_PROFILE_LIMITATION.md` documenting Chrome profile conflict
- Documented current limitation: HTTP and MCP stdio modes cannot run simultaneously
- Added roadmap for v1.4.0: Separate Chrome profiles by mode

### Fixed

**Critical Compatibility Fix:**

- Disabled `CompleteRequestSchema` handler causing crashes with Claude Desktop

- Clarified when to use manual entry vs auto-discovery
- Added fallback workflow if auto-discovery fails

**README Updates:**

- Added warning about HTTP/stdio mode conflict (temporary until v1.4.0)
- Added Chrome profile limitation to roadmap as priority feature
- Updated feature descriptions to mention MCP auto-discovery availability

### Known Issues

**Chrome Profile Locking:**

- HTTP server and MCP stdio modes cannot run simultaneously
- Both modes use same Chrome profile, causing "resource busy" errors
- **Workaround:** Choose one mode at a time, or stop HTTP daemon before using Claude Desktop
- **Fix planned:** v1.4.0 will use separate Chrome profiles automatically

---

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-23

- **Solution:** Added a 5-second delay before closing Chrome
- **File:** `src/auth/auth-manager.ts` line 966
- **Impact:** Persistent authentication now works on Windows

**Bug - Streaming Detection:**

- **Issue:** Truncated responses or placeholders returned ("Getting the context...")
