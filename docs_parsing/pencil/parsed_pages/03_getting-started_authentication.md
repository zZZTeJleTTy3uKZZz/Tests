# Authentication

Pencil requires both activation (to use Pencil itself) and Claude Code authentication (for AI features).

* * *

## Pencil Activation

### First-Time Activation

When you first launch Pencil or install the extension, you’ll be prompted to activate:

  1. **Enter your email** when prompted
  2. **Check your email** for the activation code
  3. **Enter the code** in Pencil to complete activation

### Activation Issues

**Activation email not received:**

  * Check your spam/junk folder
  * Try using a different email address
  * Wait a few minutes - emails may be delayed

**“Invite for your email address was not found. Please join the waitlist.”**

  * This can occur during activation
  * Try reinstalling the Cursor/VS Code extension
  * Contact support if the issue persists

**Repeatedly prompted for activation:**

  * This is a known issue in some versions
  * Try restarting your IDE
  * Reinstall the extension if it continues

**Activation stuck during migration:**

  * Reinstall the extension
  * Clear extension data and try again

* * *

## Claude Code Authentication

Pencil’s AI features require Claude Code to be installed and authenticated.

### Login via CLI

The recommended method is using the Claude Code CLI:
```
# Start Claude Code
    claude
     
    # Follow the browser authentication flow
```

This will:

  1. Open your browser
  2. Ask you to login with your Anthropic account
  3. Save your authentication credentials locally

### Verification

To verify you’re logged in:
```
# Check Claude Code status
    claude --version
```

Or start Pencil and look for:

  * No “Claude Code not connected” warnings
  * AI prompt panel works (Cmd/Ctrl + K)

* * *

## Common Authentication Issues

### ”Claude Code isn’t connected / not logged in”

**Solution:**

  1. Open a terminal in your project directory
  2. Run `claude` to authenticate
  3. Return to Pencil and try again

### ”Invalid API key” or “Please run /login”

**Causes:**

  * Claude Code authentication is incomplete
  * Multiple authentication methods conflict (console login + environment keys + custom provider config)
  * Credentials expired or invalid

**Solution:**

  1. Run `claude` CLI and complete authentication
  2. Check for conflicting auth configurations:
     * Remove `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variables if using CLI auth
     * Clear custom provider configs if not needed
  3. Try a clean Claude Code login session

### ”Claude CLI works, but Pencil still says I’m not logged in”

**Causes:**

  * Using third-party/custom providers with conflicting auth setup
  * Extension not recognizing CLI auth

**Solution:**

  * Ensure a clean Claude Code login session (no custom providers)
  * Restart your IDE after authenticating
  * Check that no conflicting environment variables are set

* * *

## Authentication Methods

### Recommended: Claude CLI

The simplest and most reliable method:

  * Run `claude` in your terminal
  * Login via browser
  * All Pencil features work automatically

### Alternative: API Keys

If you’re using custom authentication:

  * Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
  * Note: May conflict with CLI authentication
  * Not recommended for typical usage

* * *

## Working Flow for Authentication

A commonly successful workflow:

  1. **Install Pencil** (extension or desktop app)
  2. **Complete Pencil activation** (email code)
  3. **Install Claude Code CLI**
  4. **Authenticate Claude Code** (`claude` command)
  5. **Create a`.pen` file** in your project
  6. **Start working** \- both Pencil and AI features should work

* * *

## Permissions & Access

### Folder Access

**Issue:** “Pencil / Claude can’t access other folders”

**Cause:**

  * Folder permission restrictions
  * OS security settings

**Solution:**

  * Accept access prompts when they appear
  * Update folder permissions in system settings
  * Run your IDE/Pencil with appropriate permissions

### Missing Permission Prompts

**Issue:** “Claude requested permission to write somewhere, but I never saw a prompt”

**Workaround:**

  * Run the operation outside Pencil in a separate Claude Code session
  * Check system notification settings
  * Verify IDE permissions

* * *

## Security & Privacy

### MCP Server

  * The Pencil MCP server runs **locally** on your machine
  * No design data is sent to remote servers (except when using AI features, which send prompts to Claude)
  * The repository is currently private (no public documentation yet)

### Tool Definitions

You can inspect available MCP tools:

  * **In Cursor:** Settings → Tools & MCP
  * **In VS Code:** Check MCP configuration
  * Tool definitions show what the AI can do with your designs

* * *

## Still Having Issues?

If you’re still experiencing authentication problems:

  1. Check the [Troubleshooting guide](https://docs.pencil.dev/troubleshooting)
  2. Ensure you’re using the latest version of Pencil and Claude Code
  3. Try reinstalling both Pencil and Claude Code CLI
