# AI Integration

Pencil’s deep integration with AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables powerful design automation and workflows.

* * *

## Supported AI Assistants

Pencil works with multiple AI tools through MCP:

  * **Claude Code** (CLI and IDE)
  * **Claude Desktop**
  * **Cursor** (AI-powered IDE)
  * **Windsurf IDE** (Codeium)
  * **Codex CLI** (OpenAI)
  * **Antigravity IDE**
  * **OpenCode CLI**

* * *

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol that gives AI assistants tools to interact with your design files. Think of it as an API that lets AI read and modify `.pen` files programmatically.

### How It Works

  1. **Pencil MCP Server runs locally** \- No cloud dependency for design operations
  2. **AI assistants connect** via MCP when Pencil is running
  3. **AI can use tools** to read, modify, and generate designs
  4. **You stay in control** \- AI suggests, you approve

### Security & Privacy

  * **Local-only:** MCP server runs on your machine
  * **No remote access:** Design files stay local
  * **Repository is private:** Source code not yet public
  * **Tool inspection:** View available tools in IDE settings

* * *

## Using Claude Code

### Setup

**Prerequisites:**

  1. Install Claude Code CLI
  2. Authenticate: `claude`
  3. Have Pencil running
  4. Open a `.pen` file

### Pencil in Antigravity (or VSCode) with Claude Code panel

### Basic Workflow

  1. **Open AI prompt panel:** Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
  2. **Ask for design help:**
```
"Create a login form with email and password"
         "Add a navigation bar to this page"
         "Design a card component for my design system"
```

  3. **AI uses MCP tools** to modify your `.pen` file
  4. **See changes** reflected in the canvas immediately

### Example Prompts

**Creating designs:**

  * “Design a dashboard with sidebar and main content area”
  * “Create a pricing table with 3 tiers”
  * “Add a hero section with heading and CTA button”

**Modifying designs:**

  * “Change all primary buttons to blue”
  * “Make the sidebar narrower”
  * “Add spacing between these elements”

**Design systems:**

  * “Create a button component with variants”
  * “Generate a color palette based on #3b82f6”
  * “Build a typography scale”

**Code integration:**

  * “Generate React code for this component”
  * “Import the Header from my codebase”
  * “Create Tailwind config from these variables”

* * *

## Using Cursor

### Setup

  1. Install Pencil extension in Cursor
  2. Complete activation
  3. Authenticate Claude Code
  4. Verify MCP connection: Settings → Tools & MCP

### Using Pencil Extension in Cursor

### Cursor-Specific Features

**Inline editing:**

  * Select elements in Pencil
  * Use Cursor’s AI chat to modify
  * Changes apply to `.pen` file

**Codebase awareness:**

  * Cursor can see both your code and designs
  * Ask to sync components between them
  * Maintain consistency automatically

### Common Issues

**“Need Cursor Pro”:**

  * Some features may require Cursor Pro subscription
  * Check Cursor’s pricing for current limitations

**Prompt panel missing:**

  * Check activation/login status
  * Restart Cursor
  * Verify MCP connection in settings

* * *

## Using Codex CLI

### Setup

  1. **Run Pencil first** \- Start the desktop app or IDE extension
  2. **Open Codex** in your terminal
  3. **Verify MCP connection:**
```
/mcp
```

  4. **Pencil should appear** in the MCP server list

### Working with Codex

**Design prompts in terminal:**
```
# In Codex CLI
    > Create a button component in design.pen
    > Add a hero section to the landing page
    > Generate a color scheme based on blue
```

**Benefits:**

  * Command-line workflow
  * Scriptable design generation
  * Integrate with build tools

### Known Issues

**Codex config.toml modifications:**

  * Pencil may modify or duplicate the config
  * Issue is acknowledged and under investigation
  * Backup your config before first use

* * *

## MCP Tools Available

When AI assistants connect to Pencil via MCP, they get access to these tools:

### Design Tools

**batch_design:**

  * Create, modify, and manipulate design elements
  * Insert, copy, update, replace, move, delete operations
  * Generate and place images

**batch_get:**

  * Read design components and hierarchy
  * Search for elements by patterns
  * Inspect component structure

### Analysis Tools

**get_screenshot:**

  * Render design previews
  * Verify visual output
  * Compare before/after

**snapshot_layout:**

  * Analyze layout structure
  * Detect positioning issues
  * Find overlapping elements

**get_editor_state:**

  * Current editor context
  * Selection information
  * Active file details

### Variables & Theming

**get_variables / set_variables:**

  * Read design tokens
  * Update theme values
  * Sync with CSS

### And More

View all available tools:

  * **Cursor:** Settings → Tools & MCP
  * **VS Code:** Check MCP configuration
  * **Codex:** Run `/mcp` and inspect Pencil tools

* * *

## Advanced Workflows

### Automated Design Generation

**Style guides:** Ask AI to follow specific design systems:
```
"Create a dashboard using Material Design principles"
    "Design a landing page with modern, minimal aesthetics"
    "Build components following our design system in design-system.pen"
```

**Batch operations:**
```
"Create 5 variations of this button component"
    "Generate a complete form with all input types"
    "Design an entire landing page with hero, features, pricing, and footer"
```

### Design System Management

**Consistency enforcement:**
```
"Ensure all buttons use the primary color variable"
    "Update all headings to use the typography scale"
    "Apply 8px spacing grid to all elements"
```

**Component library:**
```
"Create a complete button component with all variants"
    "Generate form input components (text, select, checkbox, radio)"
    "Build a card component with image, title, description, and actions"
```

### Code-Design Workflows

**Import existing app:**
```
"Recreate all components from src/components in Pencil"
    "Import the design system from our Tailwind config"
    "Analyze the codebase and create matching designs"
```

**Sync changes:**
```
"Update all React components to match the Pencil designs"
    "Apply the new color scheme to both design and code"
    "Sync typography variables between CSS and Pencil"
```

* * *

## Best Practices

### Effective Prompting

**Be specific:**

  * ❌ “Make it better”
  * ✅ “Increase the button padding to 16px and change color to blue”

**Provide context:**

  * ❌ “Add a form”
  * ✅ “Add a login form with email, password, remember me checkbox, and submit button”

**Reference design systems:**

  * “Use our existing button component”
  * “Follow the spacing scale from our variables”
  * “Match the style of the header component”

### Iterative Design

  1. **Start broad:** “Create a dashboard layout”
  2. **Refine:** “Add a sidebar with navigation items”
  3. **Detail:** “Style the nav items with hover states”
  4. **Polish:** “Adjust spacing to match 8px grid”

### Verification

After AI makes changes:

  1. **Review visually** in the canvas
  2. **Check structure** in layers panel
  3. **Test interactions** if applicable
  4. **Ask for screenshots** to verify complex layouts

* * *

## Troubleshooting AI Integration

### Connection Issues

**“Claude Code not connected”:**

  1. Ensure Claude Code is logged in: `claude`
  2. Restart Pencil
  3. Open terminal in project directory and run `claude`

**MCP server not appearing:**

  1. Verify Pencil is running
  2. Check IDE MCP settings
  3. Restart both Pencil and the AI assistant

### Permission Issues

**“Can’t access folders”:**

  * Accept permission prompts
  * Check system folder permissions
  * Run IDE/Pencil with proper permissions

**“Permission prompt never appeared”:**

  * Try operation in separate Claude Code session
  * Check notification settings
  * Verify IDE permissions

### AI Output Issues

**“Invalid API key”:**

  * Re-authenticate Claude Code: `claude`
  * Check for conflicting auth configs
  * Clear environment variables

**AI makes unexpected changes:**

  * Be more specific in prompts
  * Ask AI to explain before applying
  * Use version control to revert if needed
