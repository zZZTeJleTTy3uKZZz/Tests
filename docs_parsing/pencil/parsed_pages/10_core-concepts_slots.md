# Slots

Slots are designated areas within a component where elements can be dropped in. They let you define flexible, customizable regions in your components.

## Create a Slot

  1. Create a frame and turn it into a component — press **Cmd/Ctrl + Option/Alt + K** or click the “Create component” button at the top of the properties panel
  2. Style it to your liking
  3. Click the “Make a slot” button at the top of the properties panel

  * Only empty frames in component origins can be turned into slots.
  * Slots are marked with diagonal lines on the canvas, indicating the area where elements can be dropped.

### Suggested Slot Components

Other components in the same .pen file can be marked as “suggested slot components”.

For example, a `table` component’s slot can suggest `table-row` as the intended content. Suggested slot components give both human and AI designers guidance about what belongs in a given slot.

To mark a component as suggested:

  1. Select the layer with a slot in the component origin
  2. Click the `+` button on the “Slots” line at the top of the properties panel
  3. Select the components you’d like to define as suggested

## Drop Elements into Slots

Once you have a component with a slot, you can populate it with elements.

  1. Create a component instance
  2. Drag and drop or copy and paste an element into the slot
