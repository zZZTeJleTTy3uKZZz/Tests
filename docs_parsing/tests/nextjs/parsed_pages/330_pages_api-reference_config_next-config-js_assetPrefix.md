# assetPrefix

Last updated February 20, 2026

> **Attention** : [Deploying to Vercel](/docs/pages/getting-started/deploying) automatically configures a global CDN for your Next.js project. You do not need to manually setup an Asset Prefix.

> **Good to know** : Next.js 9.5+ added support for a customizable [Base Path](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/basePath), which is better suited for hosting your application on a sub-path like `/docs`. We do not suggest you use a custom Asset Prefix for this use case.

## Set up a CDN

To set up a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), you can set up an asset prefix and configure your CDN's origin to resolve to the domain that Next.js is hosted on.

Open `next.config.mjs` and add the `assetPrefix` config based on the [phase](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js#async-configuration):

next.config.mjs
```
// @ts-check
    import { PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER } from 'next/constants'
     
    export default (phase) => {
      const isDev = phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER
      /**
       * @type {import('next').NextConfig}
       */
      const nextConfig = {
        assetPrefix: isDev ? undefined : 'https://cdn.mydomain.com',
      }
      return nextConfig
    }
```

Next.js will automatically use your asset prefix for the JavaScript and CSS files it loads from the `/_next/` path (`.next/static/` folder). For example, with the above configuration, the following request for a JS chunk:
```
/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js
```

Would instead become:
```
https://cdn.mydomain.com/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js
```

The exact configuration for uploading your files to a given CDN will depend on your CDN of choice. The only folder you need to host on your CDN is the contents of `.next/static/`, which should be uploaded as `_next/static/` as the above URL request indicates. **Do not upload the rest of your`.next/` folder**, as you should not expose your server code and other configuration to the public.

While `assetPrefix` covers requests to `_next/static`, it does not influence the following paths:

  * Files in the [public](/docs/pages/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder) folder; if you want to serve those assets over a CDN, you'll have to introduce the prefix yourself
  * `/_next/data/` requests for `getServerSideProps` pages. These requests will always be made against the main domain since they're not static.
  * `/_next/data/` requests for `getStaticProps` pages. These requests will always be made against the main domain to support [Incremental Static Generation](/docs/pages/guides/incremental-static-regeneration), even if you're not using it (for consistency).
