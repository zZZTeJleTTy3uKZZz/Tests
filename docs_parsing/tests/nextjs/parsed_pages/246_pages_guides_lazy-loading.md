# How to lazy load Client Components and libraries

Last updated February 20, 2026

[Lazy loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading) in Next.js helps improve the initial loading performance of an application by decreasing the amount of JavaScript needed to render a route.

## `next/dynamic`

`next/dynamic` is a composite of [`React.lazy()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) and [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). It behaves the same way in the `app` and `pages` directories to allow for incremental migration.

In the example below, by using `next/dynamic`, the header component will not be included in the page's initial JavaScript bundle. The page will render the Suspense `fallback` first, followed by the `Header` component when the `Suspense` boundary is resolved.
```
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
     
    const DynamicHeader = dynamic(() => import('../components/header'), {
      loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
    })
     
    export default function Home() {
      return <DynamicHeader />
    }
```

> **Good to know** : In `import('path/to/component')`, the path must be explicitly written. It can't be a template string nor a variable. Furthermore the `import()` has to be inside the `dynamic()` call for Next.js to be able to match webpack bundles / module ids to the specific `dynamic()` call and preload them before rendering. `dynamic()` can't be used inside of React rendering as it needs to be marked in the top level of the module for preloading to work, similar to `React.lazy`.

## Examples

### With named exports

To dynamically import a named export, you can return it from the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) returned by [`import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import#example):

components/hello.js
```
export function Hello() {
      return <p>Hello!</p>
    }
     
    // pages/index.js
    import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
     
    const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() =>
      import('../components/hello').then((mod) => mod.Hello)
    )
```

### With no SSR

To dynamically load a component on the client side, you can use the `ssr` option to disable server-rendering. This is useful if an external dependency or component relies on browser APIs like `window`.
```
'use client'
     
    import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
     
    const DynamicHeader = dynamic(() => import('../components/header'), {
      ssr: false,
    })
```

### With external libraries

This example uses the external library `fuse.js` for fuzzy search. The module is only loaded in the browser after the user types in the search input.
```
import { useState } from 'react'
     
    const names = ['Tim', 'Joe', 'Bel', 'Lee']
     
    export default function Page() {
      const [results, setResults] = useState()
     
      return (
        <div>
          <input
            type="text"
            placeholder="Search"
            onChange={async (e) => {
              const { value } = e.currentTarget
              // Dynamically load fuse.js
              const Fuse = (await import('fuse.js')).default
              const fuse = new Fuse(names)
     
              setResults(fuse.search(value))
            }}
          />
          <pre>Results: {JSON.stringify(results, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      )
    }
```
