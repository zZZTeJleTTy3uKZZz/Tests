# useLightningcss

This feature is currently experimental and subject to change, it's not recommended for production. Try it out and share your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues).

Last updated February 20, 2026

Experimental support for using [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev) with webpack. Lightning CSS is a fast CSS transformer and minifier, written in Rust.

If this option is not set, Next.js on webpack uses [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) with [`postcss-preset-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-preset-env) by default.

Turbopack uses Lightning CSS by default since Next 14.2. This configuration option has no effect on Turbopack. Turbopack always uses Lightning CSS.

next.config.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'
     
    const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
      experimental: {
        useLightningcss: false, // default, ignored on Turbopack
      },
    }
     
    export default nextConfig
```
