# How to set up Vitest with Next.js

Last updated February 20, 2026

Vitest and React Testing Library are frequently used together for **Unit Testing**. This guide will show you how to setup Vitest with Next.js and write your first tests.

> **Good to know:** Since `async` Server Components are new to the React ecosystem, Vitest currently does not support them. While you can still run **unit tests** for synchronous Server and Client Components, we recommend using **E2E tests** for `async` components.

## Quickstart

You can use `create-next-app` with the Next.js [with-vitest](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-vitest) example to quickly get started:

  
MAGICSTARTpnpmMAGICEND
```
pnpm create next-app --example with-vitest with-vitest-app
```

## Manual Setup

To manually set up Vitest, install `vitest` and the following packages as dev dependencies:

  
MAGICSTARTpnpmMAGICEND
```
# Using TypeScript
    pnpm add -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom vite-tsconfig-paths
    # Using JavaScript
    pnpm add -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom
```

Create a `vitest.config.mts|js` file in the root of your project, and add the following options:

vitest.config.mts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
    import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'
     
    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [tsconfigPaths(), react()],
      test: {
        environment: 'jsdom',
      },
    })
```

For more information on configuring Vitest, please refer to the [Vitest Configuration](https://vitest.dev/config/#configuration) docs.

Then, add a `test` script to your `package.json`:

package.json
```
{
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "test": "vitest"
      }
    }
```

When you run `npm run test`, Vitest will **watch** for changes in your project by default.

## Creating your first Vitest Unit Test

Check that everything is working by creating a test to check if the `<Page />` component successfully renders a heading:

pages/index.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import Link from 'next/link'
     
    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Home</h1>
          <Link href="/about">About</Link>
        </div>
      )
    }
```

__tests__/index.test.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript
```
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
    import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
    import Page from '../pages/index'
     
    test('Page', () => {
      render(<Page />)
      expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1, name: 'Home' })).toBeDefined()
    })
```

## Running your tests

Then, run the following command to run your tests:

  
MAGICSTARTpnpmMAGICEND
```
pnpm test
```
