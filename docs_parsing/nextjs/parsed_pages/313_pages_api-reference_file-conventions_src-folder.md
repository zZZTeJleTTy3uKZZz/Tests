# src Directory

Last updated February 20, 2026

As an alternative to having the special Next.js `app` or `pages` directories in the root of your project, Next.js also supports the common pattern of placing application code under the `src` folder.

This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project, which is preferred by some individuals and teams.

To use the `src` folder, move the `app` Router folder or `pages` Router folder to `src/app` or `src/pages` respectively.

> **Good to know** :
> 
>   * The `/public` directory should remain in the root of your project.
>   * Config files like `package.json`, `next.config.js` and `tsconfig.json` should remain in the root of your project.
>   * `.env.*` files should remain in the root of your project.
>   * `src/app` or `src/pages` will be ignored if `app` or `pages` are present in the root directory.
>   * If you're using `src`, you'll probably also move other application folders such as `/components` or `/lib`.
>   * If you're using Proxy, ensure it is placed inside the `src` folder.
>   * If you're using Tailwind CSS, you'll need to add the `/src` prefix to the `tailwind.config.js` file in the [content section](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration).
>   * If you are using TypeScript paths for imports such as `@/*`, you should update the `paths` object in `tsconfig.json` to include `src/`.
