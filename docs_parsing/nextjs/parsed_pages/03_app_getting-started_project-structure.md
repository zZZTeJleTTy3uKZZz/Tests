[App Router](/docs/app)[Getting Started](/docs/app/getting-started)Project Structure

# Project structure and organization

Last updated February 20, 2026

This page provides an overview of **all** the folder and file conventions in Next.js, and recommendations for organizing your project.

## Folder and file conventions

### Top-level folders

Top-level folders are used to organize your application's code and static assets.

![Route segments to path segments](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Ftop-level-folders.png&w=3840&q=75)![Route segments to path segments](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Ftop-level-folders.png&w=3840&q=75)

|   
---|---  
[`app`](/docs/app)| App Router  
[`pages`](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing)| Pages Router  
[`public`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder)| Static assets to be served  
[`src`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder)| Optional application source folder  
  
### Top-level files

Top-level files are used to configure your application, manage dependencies, run proxy, integrate monitoring tools, and define environment variables.

|   
---|---  
**Next.js**|   
[`next.config.js`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js)| Configuration file for Next.js  
[`package.json`](/docs/app/getting-started/installation#manual-installation)| Project dependencies and scripts  
[`instrumentation.ts`](/docs/app/guides/instrumentation)| OpenTelemetry and Instrumentation file  
[`proxy.ts`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/proxy)| Next.js request proxy  
[`.env`](/docs/app/guides/environment-variables)| Environment variables (should not be tracked by version control)  
[`.env.local`](/docs/app/guides/environment-variables)| Local environment variables (should not be tracked by version control)  
[`.env.production`](/docs/app/guides/environment-variables)| Production environment variables (should not be tracked by version control)  
[`.env.development`](/docs/app/guides/environment-variables)| Development environment variables (should not be tracked by version control)  
[`eslint.config.mjs`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint)| Configuration file for ESLint  
`.gitignore`| Git files and folders to ignore  
[`next-env.d.ts`](/docs/app/api-reference/config/typescript#next-envdts)| TypeScript declaration file for Next.js (should not be tracked by version control)  
`tsconfig.json`| Configuration file for TypeScript  
`jsconfig.json`| Configuration file for JavaScript  
  
### Routing Files

Add `page` to expose a route, `layout` for shared UI such as header, nav, or footer, `loading` for skeletons, `error` for error boundaries, and `route` for APIs.

| |   
---|---|---  
[`layout`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Layout  
[`page`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Page  
[`loading`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Loading UI  
[`not-found`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Not found UI  
[`error`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Error UI  
[`global-error`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/error#global-error)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Global error UI  
[`route`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route)| `.js` `.ts`| API endpoint  
[`template`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/template)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Re-rendered layout  
[`default`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default)| `.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`| Parallel route fallback page  
  
### Nested routes

Folders define URL segments. Nesting folders nests segments. Layouts at any level wrap their child segments. A route becomes public when a `page` or `route` file exists.

Path| URL pattern| Notes  
---|---|---  
`app/layout.tsx`| —| Root layout wraps all routes  
`app/blog/layout.tsx`| —| Wraps `/blog` and descendants  
`app/page.tsx`| `/`| Public route  
`app/blog/page.tsx`| `/blog`| Public route  
`app/blog/authors/page.tsx`| `/blog/authors`| Public route  
  
### Dynamic routes

Parameterize segments with square brackets. Use `[segment]` for a single param, `[...segment]` for catch‑all, and `[[...segment]]` for optional catch‑all. Access values via the [`params`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#params-optional) prop.

Path| URL pattern  
---|---  
`app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`| `/blog/my-first-post`  
`app/shop/[...slug]/page.tsx`| `/shop/clothing`, `/shop/clothing/shirts`  
`app/docs/[[...slug]]/page.tsx`| `/docs`, `/docs/layouts-and-pages`, `/docs/api-reference/use-router`  
  
### Route groups and private folders

Organize code without changing URLs with route groups [`(group)`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-groups#convention), and colocate non-routable files with private folders `_folder`.

Path| URL pattern| Notes  
---|---|---  
`app/(marketing)/page.tsx`| `/`| Group omitted from URL  
`app/(shop)/cart/page.tsx`| `/cart`| Share layouts within `(shop)`  
`app/blog/_components/Post.tsx`| —| Not routable; safe place for UI utilities  
`app/blog/_lib/data.ts`| —| Not routable; safe place for utils  
  
### Parallel and Intercepted Routes

These features fit specific UI patterns, such as slot-based layouts or modal routing.

Use `@slot` for named slots rendered by a parent layout. Use intercept patterns to render another route inside the current layout without changing the URL, for example, to show a details view as a modal over a list.

Pattern (docs)| Meaning| Typical use case  
---|---|---  
[`@folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes#slots)| Named slot| Sidebar + main content  
[`(.)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)| Intercept same level| Preview sibling route in a modal  
[`(..)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)| Intercept parent| Open a child of the parent as an overlay  
[`(..)(..)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)| Intercept two levels| Deeply nested overlay  
[`(...)folder`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/intercepting-routes#convention)| Intercept from root| Show arbitrary route in current view  
  
### Metadata file conventions

#### App icons

## Organizing your project

Next.js is **unopinionated** about how you organize and colocate your project files. But it does provide several features to help you organize your project.

### Component hierarchy

The components defined in special files are rendered in a specific hierarchy:

  * `layout.js`
  * `template.js`
  * `error.js` (React error boundary)
  * `loading.js` (React suspense boundary)
  * `not-found.js` (React error boundary for "not found" UI)
  * `page.js` or nested `layout.js`

![Component Hierarchy for File Conventions](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Ffile-conventions-component-hierarchy.png&w=3840&q=75)![Component Hierarchy for File Conventions](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Ffile-conventions-component-hierarchy.png&w=3840&q=75)

The components are rendered recursively in nested routes, meaning the components of a route segment will be nested **inside** the components of its parent segment.

![Nested File Conventions Component Hierarchy](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fnested-file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png&w=3840&q=75)![Nested File Conventions Component Hierarchy](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fnested-file-conventions-component-hierarchy.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Colocation

In the `app` directory, nested folders define route structure. Each folder represents a route segment that is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.

However, even though route structure is defined through folders, a route is **not publicly accessible** until a `page.js` or `route.js` file is added to a route segment.

![A diagram showing how a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-not-routable.png&w=3840&q=75)![A diagram showing how a route is not publicly accessible until a page.js or route.js file is added to a route segment.](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-not-routable.png&w=3840&q=75)

And, even when a route is made publicly accessible, only the **content returned** by `page.js` or `route.js` is sent to the client.

![A diagram showing how page.js and route.js files make routes publicly accessible.](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-routable.png&w=3840&q=75)![A diagram showing how page.js and route.js files make routes publicly accessible.](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-routable.png&w=3840&q=75)

This means that **project files** can be **safely colocated** inside route segments in the `app` directory without accidentally being routable.

![A diagram showing colocated project files are not routable even when a segment contains a page.js or route.js file.](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-colocation.png&w=3840&q=75)![A diagram showing colocated project files are not routable even when a segment contains a page.js or route.js file.](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-colocation.png&w=3840&q=75)

> **Good to know** : While you **can** colocate your project files in `app` you don't **have** to. If you prefer, you can keep them outside the `app` directory.

### Private folders

Private folders can be created by prefixing a folder with an underscore: `_folderName`

This indicates the folder is a private implementation detail and should not be considered by the routing system, thereby **opting the folder and all its subfolders** out of routing.

![An example folder structure using private folders](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-private-folders.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure using private folders](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-private-folders.png&w=3840&q=75)

Since files in the `app` directory can be safely colocated by default, private folders are not required for colocation. However, they can be useful for:

  * Separating UI logic from routing logic.
  * Consistently organizing internal files across a project and the Next.js ecosystem.
  * Sorting and grouping files in code editors.
  * Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file conventions.



> **Good to know** :
> 
>   * While not a framework convention, you might also consider marking files outside private folders as "private" using the same underscore pattern.
>   * You can create URL segments that start with an underscore by prefixing the folder name with `%5F` (the URL-encoded form of an underscore): `%5FfolderName`.
>   * If you don't use private folders, it would be helpful to know Next.js [special file conventions](/docs/app/getting-started/project-structure#routing-files) to prevent unexpected naming conflicts.
> 


### Route groups

Route groups can be created by wrapping a folder in parenthesis: `(folderName)`

This indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should **not be included** in the route's URL path.

![An example folder structure using route groups](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-route-groups.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure using route groups](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-route-groups.png&w=3840&q=75)

Route groups are useful for:

  * Organizing routes by site section, intent, or team. e.g. marketing pages, admin pages, etc.
  * Enabling nested layouts in the same route segment level:
    * Creating multiple nested layouts in the same segment, including multiple root layouts
    * Adding a layout to a subset of routes in a common segment



### `src` folder

Next.js supports storing application code (including `app`) inside an optional [`src` folder](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/src-folder). This separates application code from project configuration files which mostly live in the root of a project.

![An example folder structure with the `src` folder](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-src-directory.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure with the `src` folder](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-src-directory.png&w=3840&q=75)

## Examples

The following section lists a very high-level overview of common strategies. The simplest takeaway is to choose a strategy that works for you and your team and be consistent across the project.

> **Good to know** : In our examples below, we're using `components` and `lib` folders as generalized placeholders, their naming has no special framework significance and your projects might use other folders like `ui`, `utils`, `hooks`, `styles`, etc.

### Store project files outside of `app`

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of your project** and keeps the `app` directory purely for routing purposes.

![An example folder structure with project files outside of app](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-project-root.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure with project files outside of app](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-project-root.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Store project files in top-level folders inside of `app`

This strategy stores all application code in shared folders in the **root of the`app` directory**.

![An example folder structure with project files inside app](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-app-root.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure with project files inside app](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-app-root.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Split project files by feature or route

This strategy stores globally shared application code in the root `app` directory and **splits** more specific application code into the route segments that use them.

![An example folder structure with project files split by feature or route](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fproject-organization-app-root-split.png&w=3840&q=75)![An example folder structure with project files split by feature or route](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fproject-organization-app-root-split.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Organize routes without affecting the URL path

To organize routes without affecting the URL, create a group to keep related routes together. The folders in parenthesis will be omitted from the URL (e.g. `(marketing)` or `(shop)`).

![Organizing Routes with Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-group-organisation.png&w=3840&q=75)![Organizing Routes with Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-organisation.png&w=3840&q=75)

Even though routes inside `(marketing)` and `(shop)` share the same URL hierarchy, you can create a different layout for each group by adding a `layout.js` file inside their folders.

![Route Groups with Multiple Layouts](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-group-multiple-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)![Route Groups with Multiple Layouts](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-multiple-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Opting specific segments into a layout

To opt specific routes into a layout, create a new route group (e.g. `(shop)`) and move the routes that share the same layout into the group (e.g. `account` and `cart`). The routes outside of the group will not share the layout (e.g. `checkout`).

![Route Groups with Opt-in Layouts](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-group-opt-in-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)![Route Groups with Opt-in Layouts](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-opt-in-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)

### Opting for loading skeletons on a specific route

To apply a [loading skeleton](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/loading) via a `loading.js` file to a specific route, create a new route group (e.g., `/(overview)`) and then move your `loading.tsx` inside that route group.

![Folder structure showing a loading.tsx and a page.tsx inside the route group](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-group-loading.png&w=3840&q=75)![Folder structure showing a loading.tsx and a page.tsx inside the route group](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-loading.png&w=3840&q=75)

Now, the `loading.tsx` file will only apply to your dashboard → overview page instead of all your dashboard pages without affecting the URL path structure.

### Creating multiple root layouts

To create multiple [root layouts](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout#root-layout), remove the top-level `layout.js` file, and add a `layout.js` file inside each route group. This is useful for partitioning an application into sections that have a completely different UI or experience. The `<html>` and `<body>` tags need to be added to each root layout.

![Route Groups with Multiple Root Layouts](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Froute-group-multiple-root-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)![Route Groups with Multiple Root Layouts](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-group-multiple-root-layouts.png&w=3840&q=75)

In the example above, both `(marketing)` and `(shop)` have their own root layout.
