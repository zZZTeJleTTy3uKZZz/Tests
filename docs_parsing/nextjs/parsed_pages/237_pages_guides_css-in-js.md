It's possible to use any existing CSS-in-JS solution. The simplest one is inline styles:
```
function HiThere() {
      return <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>hi there</p>
    }
     
    export default HiThere
```

We bundle [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) to provide support for isolated scoped CSS. The aim is to support "shadow CSS" similar to Web Components, which unfortunately [do not support server-rendering and are JS-only](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/71).

See the above examples for other popular CSS-in-JS solutions (like Styled Components).

A component using `styled-jsx` looks like this:
```
function HelloWorld() {
      return (
        <div>
          Hello world
          <p>scoped!</p>
          <style jsx>{`
            p {
              color: blue;
            }
            div {
              background: red;
            }
            @media (max-width: 600px) {
              div {
                background: blue;
              }
            }
          `}</style>
          <style global jsx>{`
            body {
              background: black;
            }
          `}</style>
        </div>
      )
    }
     
    export default HelloWorld
```

Please see the [styled-jsx documentation](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) for more examples.

### Disabling JavaScript

Yes, if you disable JavaScript the CSS will still be loaded in the production build (`next start`). During development, we require JavaScript to be enabled to provide the best developer experience with [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#fast-refresh).
