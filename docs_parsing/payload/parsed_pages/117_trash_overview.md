# Trash

Trash (also known as soft delete) allows documents to be marked as deleted without being permanently removed. When enabled on a collection, deleted documents will receive a `deletedAt` timestamp, making it possible to restore them later, view them in a dedicated Trash view, or permanently delete them.

Soft delete is a safer way to manage content lifecycle, giving editors a chance to review and recover documents that may have been deleted by mistake.

**Note:** The Trash feature is currently in beta and may be subject to change in minor version updates.

## [Collection Configuration](/docs/trash/overview#collection-configuration)

To enable soft deleting for a collection, set the `trash` property to `true`:
```
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
      slug: 'posts',
      trash: true,
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'title',
          type: 'text',
        },
        // other fields...
      ],
    }
```

When enabled, Payload automatically injects a deletedAt field into the collection's schema. This timestamp is set when a document is soft-deleted, and cleared when the document is restored.

## [Admin Panel behavior](/docs/trash/overview#admin-panel-behavior)

Once `trash` is enabled, the Admin Panel provides a dedicated Trash view for each collection:

  * A new route is added at `/collections/:collectionSlug/trash`
  * The `Trash` view shows all documents that have a `deletedAt` timestamp



From the Trash view, you can:

  * Use bulk actions to manage trashed documents:
  * **Restore** to clear the `deletedAt` timestamp and return documents to their original state
  * **Delete** to permanently remove selected documents
  * **Empty Trash** to select and permanently delete all trashed documents at once
  * Enter each document's **edit view** , just like in the main list view. While in the edit view of a trashed document:
  * All fields are in a **read-only** state
  * Standard document actions (e.g., Save, Publish, Restore Version) are hidden and disabled.
  * The available actions are **Restore** and **Permanently Delete**.
  * Access to the **API** , **Versions** , and **Preview** views is preserved.



When deleting a document from the main collection List View, Payload will soft-delete the document by default. A checkbox in the delete confirmation modal allows users to skip the trash and permanently delete instead.

## [API Support](/docs/trash/overview#api-support)

Soft deletes are fully supported across all Payload APIs: **Local** , **REST** , and **GraphQL**.

The following operations respect and support the `trash` functionality:

  * `find`
  * `findByID`
  * `update`
  * `updateByID`
  * `delete`
  * `deleteByID`
  * `findVersions`
  * `findVersionByID`

### [Understanding `trash` Behavior](/docs/trash/overview#understanding-trash-behavior)

Passing `trash: true` to these operations will **include soft-deleted documents** in the query results.

To return _only_ soft-deleted documents, you must combine `trash: true` with a `where` clause that checks if `deletedAt` exists.

### [Examples](/docs/trash/overview#examples)#### [Local API](/docs/trash/overview#local-api)

Return all documents including trashed:
```
const result = await payload.find({
      collection: 'posts',
      trash: true,
    })
```

Return only trashed documents:
```
const result = await payload.find({
      collection: 'posts',
      trash: true,
      where: {
        deletedAt: {
          exists: true,
        },
      },
    })
```

Return only non-trashed documents:
```
const result = await payload.find({
      collection: 'posts',
      trash: false,
    })
```

#### [REST](/docs/trash/overview#rest)

Return **all** documents including trashed:
```
GET /api/posts?trash=true
```

Return **only trashed** documents:
```
GET /api/posts?trash=true&where[deletedAt][exists]=true
```

Return only non-trashed documents:
```
GET /api/posts?trash=false
```

#### [GraphQL](/docs/trash/overview#graphql)

Return all documents including trashed:
```
query {
      Posts(trash: true) {
        docs {
          id
          deletedAt
        }
      }
    }
```

Return only trashed documents:
```
query {
      Posts(
        trash: true
        where: { deletedAt: { exists: true } }
      ) {
        docs {
          id
          deletedAt
        }
      }
    }
```

Return only non-trashed documents:
```
query {
      Posts(trash: false) {
        docs {
          id
          deletedAt
        }
      }
    }
```

## [Access Control](/docs/trash/overview#access-control)

All trash-related actions (delete, permanent delete) respect the `delete` access control defined in your collection config.

This means:

  * If a user is denied delete access, they cannot soft delete or permanently delete documents

## [Versions and Trash](/docs/trash/overview#versions-and-trash)

When a document is soft-deleted:

  * It can no longer have a version **restored** until it is first restored from trash
  * Attempting to restore a version while the document is in trash will result in an error
  * This ensures consistency between the current document state and its version history



However, versions are still fully **visible and accessible** from the **edit view** of a trashed document. You can view the full version history, but must restore the document itself before restoring any individual version.
