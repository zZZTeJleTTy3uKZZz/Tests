# Upload Field

The Upload Field allows for the selection of a Document from a Collection supporting [Uploads](../upload/overview), and formats the selection as a thumbnail in the Admin Panel.

Upload fields are useful for a variety of use cases, such as:

  * To provide a `Page` with a featured image
  * To allow for a `Product` to deliver a downloadable asset like PDF or MP3
  * To give a layout building block the ability to feature a background image

To create an Upload Field, set the `type` to `upload` in your [Field Config](./overview):
```
import type { Field } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const MyUploadField: Field = {
      // ...
      type: 'upload',
      relationTo: 'media',
    }
```

**Important:** To use the Upload Field, you must have a [Collection](../configuration/collections) configured to allow [Uploads](../upload/overview).

## [Config Options](/docs/fields/upload#config-options)

Option |  Description   
---|---  
`**name**` * |  To be used as the property name when stored and retrieved from the database. [More details](../fields/overview#field-names).   
`**relationTo**` * |  Provide a single collection `slug` or an array of slugs to allow this field to accept a relation to. **Note: the related collections must be configured to support Uploads.**  
`**filterOptions**` |  A query to filter which options appear in the UI and validate against. More details.   
`**hasMany**` |  Boolean which, if set to true, allows this field to have many relations instead of only one.   
`**minRows**` |  A number for the fewest allowed items during validation when a value is present. Used with hasMany.   
`**maxRows**` |  A number for the most allowed items during validation when a value is present. Used with hasMany.   
`**maxDepth**` |  Sets a number limit on iterations of related documents to populate when queried. [Depth](../queries/depth)  
`**label**` |  Text used as a field label in the Admin Panel or an object with keys for each language.   
`**unique**` |  Enforce that each entry in the Collection has a unique value for this field.   
`**validate**` |  Provide a custom validation function that will be executed on both the Admin Panel and the backend. [More details](../fields/overview#validation).   
`**index**` |  Build an [index](../database/indexes) for this field to produce faster queries. Set this field to `true` if your users will perform queries on this field's data often.   
`**saveToJWT**` |  If this field is top-level and nested in a config supporting [Authentication](../authentication/overview), include its data in the user JWT.   
`**hooks**` |  Provide Field Hooks to control logic for this field. [More details](../hooks/fields).   
`**access**` |  Provide Field Access Control to denote what users can see and do with this field's data. [More details](../access-control/fields).   
`**hidden**` |  Restrict this field's visibility from all APIs entirely. Will still be saved to the database, but will not appear in any API or the Admin Panel.   
`**defaultValue**` |  Provide data to be used for this field's default value. [More details](../fields/overview#default-values).   
`**displayPreview**` |  Enable displaying preview of the uploaded file. Overrides related Collection's `displayPreview` option. [More details](../upload/overview#collection-upload-options).   
`**localized**` |  Enable localization for this field. Requires [localization to be enabled](../configuration/localization) in the Base config.   
`**required**` |  Require this field to have a value.   
`**admin**` |  Admin-specific configuration. [Admin Options](./overview#admin-options).   
`**custom**` |  Extension point for adding custom data (e.g. for plugins)   
`**typescriptSchema**` |  Override field type generation with providing a JSON schema   
`**virtual**` |  Provide `true` to disable field in the database, or provide a string path to [link the field with a relationship](../fields/relationship#linking-virtual-fields-with-relationships). See [Virtual Fields](/blog/learn-how-virtual-fields-can-help-solve-common-cms-challenges)  
`**graphQL**` |  Custom graphQL configuration for the field. [More details](../graphql/overview#field-complexity)  
  
_* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

## [ Example](/docs/fields/upload#example)
```
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
      slug: 'example-collection',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'backgroundImage', // required
          type: 'upload', // required
          relationTo: 'media', // required
          required: true,
        },
      ],
    }
```

## [Filtering upload options](/docs/fields/upload#filtering-upload-options)

Options can be dynamically limited by supplying a [query constraint](../queries/overview), which will be used both for validating input and filtering available uploads in the UI.

The `filterOptions` property can either be a `Where` query, or a function returning `true` to not filter, `false` to prevent all, or a `Where` query. When using a function, it will be called with an argument object with the following properties:

Property |  Description   
---|---  
`relationTo` |  The collection `slug` to filter against, limited to this field's `relationTo` property   
`data` |  An object containing the full collection or global document currently being edited   
`siblingData` |  An object containing document data that is scoped to only fields within the same parent of this field   
`id` |  The `id` of the current document being edited. `id` is `undefined` during the `create` operation   
`user` |  An object containing the currently authenticated user   
`req` |  The Payload Request, which contains references to `payload`, `user`, `locale`, and more.   
  
### [Example](/docs/fields/upload#filter-options-example)
```
const uploadField = {
      name: 'image',
      type: 'upload',
      relationTo: 'media',
      filterOptions: {
        mimeType: { contains: 'image' },
      },
    }
```

You can learn more about writing queries [here](../queries/overview).

**Note:**

When an upload field has both **filterOptions** and a custom **validate** function, the api will not validate **filterOptions** unless you call the default upload field validation function imported from **payload/shared** in your validate function.

## [Bi-directional relationships](/docs/fields/upload#bi-directional-relationships)

The `upload` field on its own is used to reference documents in an upload collection. This can be considered a "one-way" relationship. If you wish to allow an editor to visit the upload document and see where it is being used, you may use the `join` field in the upload enabled collection. Read more about bi-directional relationships using the [Join field](./join)

## [Polymorphic Uploads](/docs/fields/upload#polymorphic-uploads)

Upload fields can reference multiple upload collections by providing an array of collection slugs to the `relationTo` property.
```
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
      slug: 'example-collection',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'media',
          type: 'upload',
          relationTo: ['images', 'documents', 'videos'], // references multiple upload collections
        },
      ],
    }
```

This can be combined with the `hasMany` property to allow multiple uploads from multiple collections.
```
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const ExampleCollection: CollectionConfig = {
      slug: 'example-collection',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'media',
          type: 'upload',
          relationTo: ['images', 'documents', 'videos'], // references multiple upload collections
          hasMany: true, // allows multiple uploads
        },
      ],
    }
```
