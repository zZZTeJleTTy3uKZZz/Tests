# Sentry Plugin

![https://www.npmjs.com/package/@payloadcms/plugin-sentry](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@payloadcms/plugin-sentry)

This plugin allows you to integrate [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) seamlessly with your [Payload](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload) application.

## [What is Sentry?](/docs/plugins/sentry#what-is-sentry)

Sentry is a powerful error tracking and performance monitoring tool that helps developers identify, diagnose, and resolve issues in their applications.

Sentry does smart stuff with error data to make bugs easier to find and fix. - [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/)

This multi-faceted software offers a range of features that will help you manage errors with greater ease and ultimately ensure your application is running smoothly:

## [Core Features](/docs/plugins/sentry#core-features)

  * **Error Tracking** : Instantly captures and logs errors as they occur in your application
  * **Performance Monitoring** : Tracks application performance to identify slowdowns and bottlenecks
  * **Detailed Reports** : Provides comprehensive insights into errors, including stack traces and context
  * **Alerts and Notifications** : Send and customize event-triggered notifications
  * **Issue Grouping, Filtering and Search** : Automatically groups similar errors, and allows filtering and searching issues by custom criteria
  * **Breadcrumbs** : Records user actions and events leading up to an error
  * **Integrations** : Connects with various tools and services for enhanced workflow and issue management



This plugin is completely open-source and the [source code can be found here](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/packages/plugin-sentry). If you need help, check out our [Community Help](/community-help). If you think you've found a bug, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/issues/new?assignees=&labels=plugin%3A%20seo&template=bug_report.md&title=plugin-sentry%3A) with as much detail as possible.

## [Installation](/docs/plugins/sentry#installation)

Install the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), [npm](https://npmjs.com), or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):
```
pnpm add @payloadcms/plugin-sentry
```

## [Sentry for Next.js setup](/docs/plugins/sentry#sentry-for-nextjs-setup)

This plugin requires to complete the [Sentry + Next.js setup](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/) before.

You can use either the [automatic setup](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/#install) with the installation wizard:
```
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

Or the [Manual Setup](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/)

## [Basic Usage](/docs/plugins/sentry#basic-usage)

In the `plugins` array of your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview), call the plugin and pass in your Sentry DSN as an option.
```
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
    import { sentryPlugin } from '@payloadcms/plugin-sentry'
    import { Pages, Media } from './collections'
    
    
    import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'
    
    
    const config = buildConfig({
      collections: [Pages, Media],
      plugins: [sentryPlugin({ Sentry })],
    })
    
    
    export default config
```

## [Instrumenting Database Queries](/docs/plugins/sentry#instrumenting-database-queries)

If you want Sentry to capture Postgres query performance traces, you need to inject the Sentry-patched `pg` driver into the Postgres adapter. This ensures Sentry’s instrumentation hooks into your database calls.
```
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'
    import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
    import { sentryPlugin } from '@payloadcms/plugin-sentry'
    import { postgresAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-postgres'
    import pg from 'pg'
    
    
    export default buildConfig({
      db: postgresAdapter({
        pool: { connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL },
        pg, // Inject the patched pg driver for Sentry instrumentation
      }),
      plugins: [sentryPlugin({ Sentry })],
    })
```

## [Options](/docs/plugins/sentry#options)

  * `Sentry` : Sentry | **required**



The `Sentry` instance

Make sure to complete the Sentry for Next.js Setup before.

  * `enabled`: boolean | optional



Set to false to disable the plugin. Defaults to `true`.

  * `context`: `(args: ContextArgs) => Partial<ScopeContext> | Promise<Partial<ScopeContext>>`



Pass additional [contextual data](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/#passing-context-directly) to Sentry

  * `captureErrors`: number[] | optional



By default, `Sentry.errorHandler` will capture only errors with a status code of 500 or higher. To capture additional error codes, pass the values as numbers in an array.

### [Example](/docs/plugins/sentry#example)

Configure any of these options by passing them to the plugin:
```
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
    import { sentryPlugin } from '@payloadcms/plugin-sentry'
    
    
    import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'
    
    
    import { Pages, Media } from './collections'
    
    
    const config = buildConfig({
      collections: [Pages, Media],
      plugins: [
        sentryPlugin({
          options: {
            captureErrors: [400, 403],
            context: ({ defaultContext, req }) => {
              return {
                ...defaultContext,
                tags: {
                  locale: req.locale,
                },
              }
            },
            debug: true,
          },
          Sentry,
        }),
      ],
    })
    
    
    export default config
```

## [TypeScript](/docs/plugins/sentry#typescript)

All types can be directly imported:
```
import { PluginOptions } from '@payloadcms/plugin-sentry'
```
