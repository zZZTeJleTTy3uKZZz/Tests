# Authentication Emails

[Authentication](./overview) ties directly into the [Email](../email/overview) functionality that Payload provides. This allows you to send emails to users for verification, password resets, and more. While Payload provides default email templates for these actions, you can customize them to fit your brand.

## [Email Verification](/docs/authentication/email#email-verification)

Email Verification forces users to prove they have access to the email address they can authenticate. This will help to reduce spam accounts and ensure that users are who they say they are.

To enable Email Verification, use the `auth.verify` property on your [Collection Config](../configuration/collections):
```
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const Customers: CollectionConfig = {
      // ...
      auth: {
        verify: true, 
      },
    }
```

**Tip:** Verification emails are fully customizable. More details.

The following options are available:

Option |  Description   
---|---  
`**generateEmailHTML**` |  Allows for overriding the HTML within emails that are sent to users indicating how to validate their account. More details.   
`**generateEmailSubject**` |  Allows for overriding the subject of the email that is sent to users indicating how to validate their account. More details.   
  
#### [generateEmailHTML](/docs/authentication/email#generateemailhtml)

Function that accepts one argument, containing `{ req, token, user }`, that allows for overriding the HTML within emails that are sent to users indicating how to validate their account. The function should return a string that supports HTML, which can optionally be a full HTML email.
```
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const Customers: CollectionConfig = {
      // ...
      auth: {
        verify: {
          generateEmailHTML: ({ req, token, user }) => {
            // Use the token provided to allow your user to verify their account
            const url = `https://yourfrontend.com/verify?token=${token}`
    
    
            return `Hey ${user.email}, verify your email by clicking here: ${url}`
          },
        },
      },
    }
```

**Important:** If you specify a different URL to send your users to for email verification, such as a page on the frontend of your app or similar, you need to handle making the call to the Payload REST or GraphQL verification operation yourself on your frontend, using the token that was provided for you. Above, it was passed via query parameter.

#### [generateEmailSubject](/docs/authentication/email#generateemailsubject)

Similarly to the above `generateEmailHTML`, you can also customize the subject of the email. The function arguments are the same but you can only return a string - not HTML.
```
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const Customers: CollectionConfig = {
      // ...
      auth: {
        verify: {
          generateEmailSubject: ({ req, user }) => {
            return `Hey ${user.email}, reset your password!`
          },
        },
      },
    }
```

## [Forgot Password](/docs/authentication/email#forgot-password)

You can customize how the Forgot Password workflow operates with the following options on the `auth.forgotPassword` property:
```
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const Customers: CollectionConfig = {
      // ...
      auth: {
        forgotPassword: {
          
          // ...
        },
      },
    }
```

The following options are available:

Option |  Description   
---|---  
`**expiration**` |  Configure how long password reset tokens remain valid, specified in milliseconds.   
`**generateEmailHTML**` |  Allows for overriding the HTML within emails that are sent to users attempting to reset their password. More details.   
`**generateEmailSubject**` |  Allows for overriding the subject of the email that is sent to users attempting to reset their password. More details.   
  
**Tip:** Payload provides a built-in password reset page. If you don't need a custom frontend, you can link directly to `${serverURL}/admin/reset/${token}`. The admin and reset routes are configurable via `config.routes.admin` and `config.admin.routes.reset` respectively.

#### [generateEmailHTML](/docs/authentication/email#generateemailhtml)

This function allows for overriding the HTML within emails that are sent to users attempting to reset their password. The function should return a string that supports HTML, which can be a full HTML email.
```
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const Customers: CollectionConfig = {
      // ...
      auth: {
        forgotPassword: {
          generateEmailHTML: ({ req, token, user }) => {
            // Use the token provided to allow your user to reset their password
            const resetPasswordURL = `https://yourfrontend.com/reset-password?token=${token}`
    
    
            return `
              <!doctype html>
              <html>
                <body>
                  <h1>Here is my custom email template!</h1>
                  <p>Hello, ${user.email}!</p>
                  <p>Click below to reset your password.</p>
                  <p>
                    <a href="${resetPasswordURL}">${resetPasswordURL}</a>
                  </p>
                </body>
              </html>
            `
          },
        },
      },
    }
```

**Important:** If you specify a different URL to send your users to for resetting their password, such as a page on the frontend of your app or similar, you need to handle making the call to the Payload REST or GraphQL reset-password operation yourself on your frontend, using the token that was provided for you. Above, it was passed via query parameter.

**Tip:** HTML templating can be used to create custom email templates, inline CSS automatically, and more. You can make a reusable function that standardizes all email sent from Payload, which makes sending custom emails more DRY. Payload doesn't ship with an HTML templating engine, so you are free to choose your own.

The following arguments are passed to the `generateEmailHTML` function:

Argument |  Description   
---|---  
`req` |  The request object.   
`token` |  The token that is generated for the user to reset their password.   
`user` |  The user document that is attempting to reset their password.   
  
#### [generateEmailSubject](/docs/authentication/email#generateemailsubject)

Similarly to the above `generateEmailHTML`, you can also customize the subject of the email. The function arguments are the same but you can only return a string - not HTML.
```
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const Customers: CollectionConfig = {
      // ...
      auth: {
        forgotPassword: {
          generateEmailSubject: ({ req, user }) => {
            return `Hey ${user.email}, reset your password!`
          },
        },
      },
    }
```

The following arguments are passed to the `generateEmailSubject` function:

Argument |  Description   
---|---  
`req` |  The request object.   
`user` |  The user document that is attempting to reset their password.
