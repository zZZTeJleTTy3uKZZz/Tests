# Advanced uses and examples

The plugin also exposes its internal utilities so that you can use only the parts that you need without using the entire plugin. This is useful if you want to build your own ecommerce solution on top of Payload.

## [Using only the collections](/docs/ecommerce/advanced#using-only-the-collections)

You can import the collections directly from the plugin and add them to your Payload configuration. This way, you can use the collections without using the entire plugin:

Name |  Collection |  Description   
---|---|---  
`createAddressesCollection` |  `addresses` |  Used for customer addresses (like shipping and billing). More  
`createCartsCollection` |  `carts` |  Carts can be used by customers, guests and once purchased are kept for records and analytics. More  
`createOrdersCollection` |  `orders` |  Orders are used to store customer-side information and are related to at least one transaction. More  
`createTransactionsCollection` |  `transactions` |  Handles payment information accessible by admins only, related to Orders. More  
`createProductsCollection` |  `products` |  All the product information lives here, contains prices, relations to Variant Types and joins to Variants. More  
`createVariantsCollection` |  `variants` |  Product variants, unique purchasable items that are linked to a product and Variant Options. More  
`createVariantTypesCollection` |  `variantTypes` |  A taxonomy used by Products to relate Variant Options together. An example of a Variant Type is "size". More  
`createVariantOptionsCollection` |  `variantOptions` |  Related to a Variant Type to handle a unique property of it. An example of a Variant Option is "small". More

## [Typescript](/docs/ecommerce/advanced#typescript)

There are several common types that you'll come across when working with this package. These are export from the package as well and are used across individual utilities as well.

### [CurrenciesConfig](/docs/ecommerce/advanced#currenciesconfig)

Defines the supported currencies in Payload and the frontend. It has the following properties:

Property |  Type |  Description   
---|---|---  
`defaultCurrency` |  `string` |  The default currency code. Must match one of the codes in the `currencies` array.   
`currencies` |  `CurrencyType[]` |  An array of supported currencies. Each currency must have a unique code.   
  
### [Currency](/docs/ecommerce/advanced#currency)

Defines a currency to be used in the application. It has the following properties:

Property |  Type |  Description   
---|---|---  
`code` |  `string` |  The ISO 4217 currency code. Example `'usd'`.   
`symbol` |  `string` |  The symbol of the currency. Example `'$'`  
`label` |  `string` |  The name of the currency. Example `'USD'`  
`decimals` |  `number` |  The number of decimal places to use. Example `2`  
  
The decimals is very important to provide as we store all prices as integers to avoid floating point issues. For example, if you're using USD, you would store a price of $10.00 as `1000` (10 * 10^2), so when formatting the price for display we need to know how many decimal places the currency supports.

### [CountryType](/docs/ecommerce/advanced#countrytype)

Used to define a country in address fields and supported countries lists. It has the following properties:

Property |  Type |  Description   
---|---|---  
`value` |  `string` |  The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code.   
`label` |  `string` |  The name of the country.   
  
### [InventoryConfig](/docs/ecommerce/advanced#inventoryconfig)

It's used to customise the inventory tracking settings on products and variants. It has the following properties:

Property |  Type |  Description   
---|---|---  
`fieldName` |  `string` |  (Optional) The name of the field to use for tracking stock. Defaults to `inventory`.
