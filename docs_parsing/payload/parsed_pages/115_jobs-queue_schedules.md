# Job Schedules

Payload's `schedule` property lets you enqueue Jobs regularly according to a cron schedule - daily, weekly, hourly, or any custom interval. This is ideal for tasks or workflows that must repeat automatically and without manual intervention.

Scheduling Jobs differs significantly from running them:

  * **Queueing** : Scheduling only creates (enqueues) the Job according to your cron expression. It does not immediately execute any business logic.
  * **Running** : Execution happens separately through your Jobs runner - such as autorun, or manual invocation using `payload.jobs.run()` or the `payload-jobs/run` endpoint.



Use the `schedule` property specifically when you have recurring tasks or workflows. To enqueue a single Job to run once in the future, use the `waitUntil` property instead.

## [When to use Schedules](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#when-to-use-schedules)

Here's a quick guide to help you choose the right approach:

Approach |  Use Case |  Example   
---|---|---  
**Schedule** |  Recurring tasks that run automatically on a schedule |  Daily reports, weekly emails, hourly syncs   
**waitUntil** |  One-time job in the future |  Publish a post at 3pm tomorrow, send trial expiry email in 7 days   
**Collection Hook** |  Job triggered by document changes |  Send email when post is published, generate PDF when order is created   
**Manual Queue** |  Job triggered by user action or API call |  User clicks "Generate Report" button   
  
## [Complete Setup Requirements](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#complete-setup-requirements)

**Critical:** To use scheduled jobs, you need TWO configurations working together. Configuring only one will not work.

### [1\. Schedule Configuration (This Page)](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#1-schedule-configuration-this-page)

Define the `schedule` property on your task or workflow to automatically queue jobs:
```
{
      slug: 'myTask',
      schedule: [{ cron: '0 9 * * *', queue: 'daily' }],
      handler: async () => { /* ... */ }
    }
```

This handles the **QUEUING** —it adds jobs to the database on a schedule.

[](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#2-runner-configuration-see)

### [2\. Runner Configuration (See ](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#2-runner-configuration-see)[Queues](../jobs-queue/queues))

Configure how queued jobs are executed. For dedicated servers, use bin scripts (recommended):
```
# Recommended: Bin script runs in separate process
    pnpm payload jobs:run --cron "* * * * *" --queue daily --handle-schedules
```

Or use autoRun (alternative):
```
jobs: {
      autoRun: [{ cron: '* * * * *', queue: 'daily' }]
    }
```

This handles the **RUNNING** —it executes the job handler functions.

### [Quick Checklist](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#quick-checklist)

Before wondering why your scheduled jobs aren't working, verify:

  * **Task has**`**schedule**`**property?** → Jobs will be queued automatically
  * **Config has**`**autoRun**`**or another runner?** → Queued jobs will be executed
  * **Both use the same**`**queue**`**name?** → Jobs will flow from schedule to execution
  * **Not on serverless platform?** → `autoRun` requires a long-running server



If any checkbox is missing, your scheduled jobs won't work properly.

**Example comparison:**
```
// Bad practice - Using schedule for one-time future job
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 15 * * *', queue: 'default' }] // Runs every day at 3pm
    
    
    // Best practice - Use waitUntil for one-time future job
    await payload.jobs.queue({
      task: 'publishPost',
      input: { postId: '123' },
      waitUntil: new Date('2024-12-25T15:00:00Z'), // Runs once at this specific time
    })
    
    
    // Best practice - Use schedule for recurring jobs
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 0 * * *', queue: 'nightly' }] // Runs every day at midnight
```

## [Handling schedules](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#handling-schedules)

Something needs to actually trigger the scheduling of jobs (execute the scheduling lifecycle seen below). There are several ways to handle scheduling:

### [Bin Scripts (Recommended for Dedicated Servers)](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#bin-scripts-recommended-for-dedicated-servers)

For dedicated servers, the recommended approach is to use Payload's bin scripts. This runs the scheduling logic in a separate process from your Next.js server.

**Combined scheduling and running (recommended):**
```
# This will both schedule jobs according to the configuration AND run them
    pnpm payload jobs:run --cron "*/5 * * * *" --queue myQueue --handle-schedules
```

**Schedule-only (if you want separate processes for scheduling vs running):**
```
# This only handles scheduling - you'll need a separate process to run jobs
    pnpm payload jobs:handle-schedules --cron "*/5 * * * *" --queue myQueue
    # or for all queues:
    pnpm payload jobs:handle-schedules --cron "*/5 * * * *" --all-queues
```

**Benefits of bin scripts:**

  * Separate process from Next.js server
  * Easy to deploy as independent workers
  * Simple to scale by running multiple instances
  * No impact on Next.js server performance

### [autoRun (Alternative for Dedicated Servers)](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#autorun-alternative-for-dedicated-servers)

By default, the `jobs.autoRun` configuration handles scheduling for the queue specified in the `autoRun` configuration:
```
jobs: {
      autoRun: [
        {
          cron: '*/5 * * * *',
          queue: 'default',
          // disableScheduling: false (default) - schedules are handled automatically
        },
      ],
    }
```

You can disable this behavior by setting `disableScheduling: true` in your `autoRun` configuration if you want to handle scheduling separately.

### [API Endpoint (For Serverless)](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#api-endpoint-for-serverless)

For serverless environments, you can trigger scheduling via the `/api/payload-jobs/run` endpoint (which handles scheduling by default) or use the dedicated `/api/payload-jobs/handle-schedules` endpoint:
```
// This endpoint handles both scheduling and running
    await fetch('/api/payload-jobs/run?queue=myQueue')
    
    
    // Or disable scheduling if you want to handle it separately
    await fetch('/api/payload-jobs/run?queue=myQueue&disableScheduling=true')
    
    
    // Dedicated scheduling endpoint
    await fetch('/api/payload-jobs/handle-schedules?queue=myQueue')
```

### [Local API (For Programmatic Control)](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#local-api-for-programmatic-control)

You can also handle scheduling programmatically:
```
await payload.jobs.handleSchedules()
```

## [Defining schedules on Tasks or Workflows](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#defining-schedules-on-tasks-or-workflows)

Schedules are defined using the `schedule` property:
```
export type ScheduleConfig = {
      cron: string // required, supports seconds precision
      queue: string // required, the queue to push Jobs onto
      hooks?: {
        // Optional hooks to customize scheduling behavior
        beforeSchedule?: BeforeScheduleFn
        afterSchedule?: AfterScheduleFn
      }
    }
```

### [Example schedule](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#example-schedule)

The following example demonstrates scheduling a Job to enqueue every day at midnight:
```
import type { TaskConfig } from 'payload'
    
    
    export const SendDigestEmail: TaskConfig<'SendDigestEmail'> = {
      slug: 'SendDigestEmail',
      schedule: [
        {
          cron: '0 0 * * *', // Every day at midnight
          queue: 'nightly',
        },
      ],
      handler: async () => {
        await sendDigestToAllUsers()
      },
    }
```

This configuration only queues the Job - it does not execute it immediately. To actually run the queued Job, you have several options:

**Option 1: Bin script (recommended for dedicated servers):**
```
# This will both schedule and run jobs from the nightly queue
    pnpm payload jobs:run --cron "* * * * *" --queue nightly --handle-schedules
```

**Option 2: autoRun (alternative for dedicated servers):**
```
export default buildConfig({
      jobs: {
        autoRun: [
          {
            cron: '* * * * *', // Runs every minute
            queue: 'nightly',
          },
        ],
        tasks: [SendDigestEmail],
      },
    })
```

**Option 3: API endpoint (for serverless platforms):**

Configure Vercel Cron or similar to trigger:
```
GET /api/payload-jobs/run?queue=nightly
```

With any of these options, Payload's scheduler will automatically enqueue the job into the `nightly` queue every day at midnight, and the runner will check the `nightly` queue every minute to execute any Jobs that are due to run.

## [Scheduling lifecycle](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#scheduling-lifecycle)

Here's how the scheduling process operates in detail:

  1. **Cron evaluation** : Payload (or your external trigger in `manual` mode) identifies which schedules are due to run. To do that, it will  
read the `payload-jobs-stats` global which contains information about the last time each scheduled task or workflow was run.
  2. **BeforeSchedule hook** :


  * The default beforeSchedule hook checks how many active or runnable jobs of the same type that have been queued by the scheduling system currently exist.  
If such a job exists, it will skip scheduling a new one.
  * You can provide your own `beforeSchedule` hook to customize this behavior. For example, you might want to allow multiple overlapping Jobs or dynamically set the Job input data.


  1. **Enqueue Job** : Payload queues up a new job. This job will have `waitUntil` set to the next scheduled time based on the cron expression.
  2. **AfterSchedule hook** :


  * The default afterSchedule hook updates the `payload-jobs-stats` global metadata with the last scheduled time for the Job.
  * You can provide your own afterSchedule hook to it for custom logging, metrics, or other post-scheduling actions.

## [Customizing concurrency and input](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#customizing-concurrency-and-input)

You may want more control over concurrency or dynamically set Job inputs at scheduling time. For instance, allowing multiple overlapping Jobs to be scheduled, even if a previously scheduled job has not completed yet, or preparing dynamic data to pass to your Job handler:
```
import { countRunnableOrActiveJobsForQueue } from 'payload'
    
    
    schedule: [
      {
        cron: '* * * * *', // every minute
        queue: 'reports',
        hooks: {
          beforeSchedule: async ({ queueable, req }) => {
            const runnableOrActiveJobsForQueue =
              await countRunnableOrActiveJobsForQueue({
                queue: queueable.scheduleConfig.queue,
                req,
                taskSlug: queueable.taskConfig?.slug,
                workflowSlug: queueable.workflowConfig?.slug,
                onlyScheduled: true,
              })
    
    
            // Allow up to 3 simultaneous scheduled jobs and set dynamic input
            return {
              shouldSchedule: runnableOrActiveJobsForQueue < 3,
              input: { text: 'Hi there' },
            }
          },
        },
      },
    ]
```

This allows fine-grained control over how many Jobs can run simultaneously and provides dynamically computed input values each time a Job is scheduled.

## [Scheduling in serverless environments](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#scheduling-in-serverless-environments)

On serverless platforms, scheduling must be triggered externally since Payload does not automatically run cron schedules in ephemeral environments. You have two main ways to trigger scheduling manually:

  * **Invoke via Payload's API:** `payload.jobs.handleSchedules()`
  * **Use the REST API endpoint:** `/api/payload-jobs/handle-schedules`
  * **Use the run endpoint, which also handles scheduling by default:** `GET /api/payload-jobs/run`



For example, on Vercel, you can set up a Vercel Cron to regularly trigger scheduling:

  * **Vercel Cron Job:** Configure Vercel Cron to periodically call `GET /api/payload-jobs/handle-schedules`. If you would like to auto-run your scheduled jobs as well, you can use the `GET /api/payload-jobs/run` endpoint.



Once Jobs are queued, their execution depends entirely on your configured runner setup (e.g., autorun, or manual invocation).

## [Common Schedule Patterns](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#common-schedule-patterns)

Here are typical cron expressions for common scheduling needs:
```
// Every minute
    schedule: [{ cron: '* * * * *', queue: 'frequent' }]
    
    
    // Every 5 minutes
    schedule: [{ cron: '*/5 * * * *', queue: 'default' }]
    
    
    // Every hour at minute 0
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 * * * *', queue: 'hourly' }]
    
    
    // Every day at midnight (00:00)
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 0 * * *', queue: 'nightly' }]
    
    
    // Every day at 2:30 AM
    schedule: [{ cron: '30 2 * * *', queue: 'nightly' }]
    
    
    // Every Monday at 9:00 AM
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 9 * * 1', queue: 'weekly' }]
    
    
    // First day of every month at midnight
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 0 1 * *', queue: 'monthly' }]
    
    
    // Every weekday (Mon-Fri) at 8:00 AM
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 8 * * 1-5', queue: 'weekdays' }]
    
    
    // Every 30 seconds (with seconds precision)
    schedule: [{ cron: '*/30 * * * * *', queue: 'frequent' }]
```

**Cron format reference:**
```
* * * * * *
    │ │ │ │ │ │
    │ │ │ │ │ └─ Day of week (0-7, 0 and 7 = Sunday)
    │ │ │ │ └─── Month (1-12)
    │ │ │ └───── Day of month (1-31)
    │ │ └─────── Hour (0-23)
    │ └───────── Minute (0-59)
    └─────────── Second (0-59, optional)
```

### [Real-World Examples](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#real-world-examples)

**Daily digest email:**
```
export const DailyDigestTask: TaskConfig<'DailyDigest'> = {
      slug: 'DailyDigest',
      schedule: [
        {
          cron: '0 7 * * *', // Every day at 7:00 AM
          queue: 'emails',
        },
      ],
      handler: async ({ req }) => {
        const users = await req.payload.find({
          collection: 'users',
          where: { digestEnabled: { equals: true } },
        })
    
    
        for (const user of users.docs) {
          await sendDigestEmail(user.email)
        }
    
    
        return { output: { emailsSent: users.docs.length } }
      },
    }
```

**Weekly report generation:**
```
export const WeeklyReportTask: TaskConfig<'WeeklyReport'> = {
      slug: 'WeeklyReport',
      schedule: [
        {
          cron: '0 9 * * 1', // Every Monday at 9:00 AM
          queue: 'reports',
        },
      ],
      handler: async ({ req }) => {
        const report = await generateWeeklyReport()
        await req.payload.create({
          collection: 'reports',
          data: report,
        })
    
    
        return { output: { reportId: report.id } }
      },
    }
```

**Hourly data sync:**
```
export const SyncDataTask: TaskConfig<'SyncData'> = {
      slug: 'SyncData',
      schedule: [
        {
          cron: '0 * * * *', // Every hour
          queue: 'sync',
        },
      ],
      handler: async ({ req }) => {
        const data = await fetchFromExternalAPI()
        await req.payload.create({
          collection: 'synced-data',
          data,
        })
    
    
        return { output: { itemsSynced: data.length } }
      },
    }
```

## [Troubleshooting Schedules](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#troubleshooting-schedules)

Here are a few things to check when scheduled jobs are not being queued:

**Is schedule handling enabled?**
```
// Make sure autoRun doesn't disable scheduling
    jobs: {
      autoRun: [
        {
          cron: '*/5 * * * *',
          queue: 'default',
          disableScheduling: false, // Should be false or omitted
        },
      ],
    }
```

**Is the cron expression valid?**
```
// Invalid cron - 6 fields (with seconds) but missing day of week
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 0 * * *', queue: 'default' }] // Missing 6th field
    
    
    // Valid cron - 5 fields (standard format)
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 0 * * *', queue: 'default' }]
    
    
    // Valid cron - 6 fields (with seconds)
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 0 0 * * *', queue: 'default' }]
```

Test your cron expressions at [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) (for 5-field format).

**Check the payload-jobs-stats global**
```
const stats = await payload.findGlobal({
      slug: 'payload-jobs-stats',
    })
    
    
    console.log(stats.lastScheduled) // Check when each task was last scheduled
```

### [Scheduled Jobs queued but not running](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#scheduled-jobs-queued-but-not-running)

This means scheduling is working, but execution isn't. See the [Queues troubleshooting](../jobs-queue/queues#troubleshooting) section.

### [Jobs running at wrong times](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#jobs-running-at-wrong-times)

**Issue: Job scheduled for midnight but runs immediately**

This happens when `waitUntil` isn't set properly. Check your schedule config:
```
// The schedule property only queues the job
    // The autoRun picks it up and runs it
    schedule: [{ cron: '0 0 * * *', queue: 'nightly' }]
    
    
    // Make sure autoRun checks the queue frequently enough
    autoRun: [
      {
        cron: '* * * * *', // Check every minute
        queue: 'nightly',
      },
    ]
```

### [Multiple instances of the same scheduled job](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#multiple-instances-of-the-same-scheduled-job)

By default, Payload prevents duplicate scheduled jobs. If you're seeing duplicates:

**Are you running multiple servers without coordination?**

If multiple servers are handling schedules, they might each queue jobs. Solution: Only enable schedule handling on one server:
```
// Server 1 (handles schedules)
    jobs: {
      shouldAutoRun: () => process.env.HANDLE_SCHEDULES === 'true',
      autoRun: [/* ... */],
    }
    
    
    // Server 2 (just processes jobs, no scheduling)
    jobs: {
      shouldAutoRun: () => process.env.HANDLE_SCHEDULES !== 'true',
      autoRun: [{ disableScheduling: true }],
    }
```

### [Custom beforeSchedule hook](/docs/jobs-queue/schedules#custom-beforeschedule-hook)

If you have a custom `beforeSchedule` hook, make sure it properly checks for existing jobs:
```
import { countRunnableOrActiveJobsForQueue } from 'payload'
    
    
    hooks: {
      beforeSchedule: async ({ queueable, req }) => {
        const count = await countRunnableOrActiveJobsForQueue({
          queue: queueable.scheduleConfig.queue,
          req,
          taskSlug: queueable.taskConfig?.slug,
          onlyScheduled: true,
        })
    
    
        return {
          shouldSchedule: count === 0, // Only schedule if no jobs exist
        }
      },
    }
```
